								<h3>It is my passion</h3>
								<p>Life is short and fleeting I have simply discovered how to make that time count. I have discovered through all aspects of Computer Science my own definition of what it means to  actually "live". The short time I will live, will be infinite through discovery, science, and learning. I have chosen Computer Science as my field of study because it fascinates me and fulfills my deep curiosity for the world.</p>

								<p>My goal is to excel. I want my future to be filled with struggles so that I can reach for perfection and never reach it. In this way I will never stop progressing and never stop advancing my skill set. As I look back on my years in college I have worked on many projects that were seemingly impossible and out of my reach; every time I found myself lost, but never hopeless. With hard work, persistence, and aggressively enforcing countless ideas that seemed like the solution, every failure I had always brought me closer to finishing the assignment.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>A joyful feeling</h4>
								<p>The joy I feel in achieving the seemingly impossible has become an addiction, but one I see as a necessity to succeed in anything I tackle in the future. Besides my enthusiasm for self development and programming experience, the best skills I have to offer is my stubborn will to keep moving forward and a personality strong enough to bring out the best in others. I work well with others, only see the best in people and collaborate to bring that out.</p>

								<p> I believe that my symbiotic personality is key and more efficient than working independently. These however are merely words and I believe in action. Allow me to demonstrate my mantras of life. I only see success in my future and when challenged I already feel like I've succeeded. Challenge me so we can succeed together.</p>
